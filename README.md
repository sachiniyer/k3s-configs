# k3s-configs

These are all of my k3s configs. 

All passwords should be in a gpg encrypted file called pass (I am including it cause I want the passwords to be versioned as well, and I think this is safe?). If they are not please let me know.

Things are haphazard, sorry. If you want to know more about the cluster I have a [separate repo](https://github.com/sachiniyer/cheap_portable_k3s)
